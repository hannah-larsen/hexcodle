          <strong>Bugs:</strong> Please note that our easy/hard toggle is a bit
          buggy if you try to switch it mid-game, we are aware and working on
          fixing it! We are also aware of the issue of an infinite archive by pressing
          the left-side arrow - consider this Hexcodle unlimited (until we get this fixed)üòÖ
