About a month ago, Ekim and I had the pleasure of reviewing your *fabulous* submissions for the Hexcodle Mini colour contest. It was a shame we could only pick 3 winners because there were some truly great (and utterly unhinged) names. To begin, let's give another round of applause to our three winners. **Congratulations Kaylie, Thomas and Joseph!**

Now the moment you've all been patiently awaiting... Reviewing our runner-up's!

**Our Fave Funny Submissions:**
