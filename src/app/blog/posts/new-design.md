Long time no talk, Hexcodlers!

As you may know, we have a [feedback form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSe_EMsc0Gf00wNMl4xZ1t2VcGSY4k7NvqVAnnpoXCi16YgVxw/viewform) linked at the bottom of our site. We may not respond to your feedback as quickly as we like, but rest assured, every submission gets reviewed. Being a small web game, we take pride in listening to our players' feedback and ultimately want to make sure you have the *best* playing experience.

Here's an overview of everything we implemented in this new patch:

### New design
While we liked our old design, we felt it was time for an upgrade. Being a very design-oriented game, we thought a fresh design with pops of colour & fun zigzag patterns would be perfect! With these design changes, our navbar also works a bit differently than before. Click on the top banner to expand a sliding menu with the archive, blog and more!

### Colours beside each guess
Previously, players could see their past colour guesses in the small square beside the target, with a subtle outline showing progression. Now, each guess features a medium-sized colour box, making it much easier to visualize how your guesses evolve over time.

### Mobile accessibility updates
Playing on mobile just got smoother! Our new on-screen keyboard now includes only the letters and numbers needed for hex codes. No more confusion or accidentally typing a “Z” mid-guess.
