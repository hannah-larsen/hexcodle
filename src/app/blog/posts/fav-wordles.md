Every night, as soon as the clock strikes midnight, Ekim and I make it a routine to run through our ***very extensive*** list of daily Wordle-games. We've had this tradition for slightly over a year now, and it's so fun finding new daily games to play. For the sake of authenticity, I will also be listing these in the particular order we play every night (and yes, the order does in fact matter).

**Game List:**
1. [The NYT Mini Crossword](https://www.nytimes.com/crosswords/game/mini)
2. [Wordle](https://www.nytimes.com/wordle)
3. [Connections](https://www.nytimes.com/connections)

### **The NYT Mini Crossword**

Personally, my brain shuts off at around 8pm every day, and the thought of doing a full crossword makes my head explode. **The Mini Crossword is a perfect way to jumpstart the daily Wordle grind.** Fun fact, NYT releases the Mini every night at 10pm (and 6pm on Sunday's!) instead of midnight, so if you're hungering for a little crossword action earlier than midnight, this is the perfect game for you!

### **Wordle**

The classic gateway game into dailies. **The goal is simple: guess the correct 5-letter word.** Thankfully, Wordle is nice and gives you hints by revealing if you have letters in the correct places. I still have flashbacks from when the daily word was KAYAK. Fun fact, Ekim and I have gotten the Wordle in 1 exactly one time using the word TOUCH and we freaked out.

### **Connections**

**Finding 4 groups from a 16 word pool is easy, *right?*** I really want to have a chat with the creator of this game and ask where the inspiration for these groupings comes from because half the time it genuinely makes NO SENSE!!!! Please tell me I'm not the only one...
 
### **Plusword**

This game is like if Wordle and the NYT Mini Crossword had a love child. **It's crossword-like layout gives you the illusion you just need to figure out words based on the clues, but at the bottom of the game board, there's a mystery word** that's comprised of highlighted letters in your crossword grid! 

### **Twofer Goofer**

Currently Ekim's fav, you **guess a rhyming pair of words based on the clue given.** At the end of the game, an AI-generated image of the word pairing pops up and some of the pictures are so unhinged, we always get such a good laugh out of this game. Rumor has it that you can also buy merch from this game with the aformentioned unhinged AI images, do with that information as you please.

### **Flagle**

You have 6 tries to **guess the flag** from little sections of the flag that are revealed after each incorrect guess. The game also shows you how close each guess is to the target, so even if you're stumped and don't know your flags, it's really fun!

### **Globle**

**Guess the mystery country** based off how 'hot' and 'cold' your country guesses are. This is a lot of fun if you're a big geography nerd like us.

### **Travle**

Your goal is to **find a path of countries that links the two daily countries together**. Sometimes the daily challenge forbids you from travelling through specific countries, so it does get very entertaining and keeps your geography knowledge sharp!

### **Angle**

**Guess the angle. That's it. 10/10 game.**

### **Hexcodle**

Shameless self plug! Calling all designers, colour-enthusiasts and daily-game-player's: **guess the hex code of the daily mystery colour** and share results with your friends! We just recently created the highly-requested [Hexcodle Mini](https://hexcodle.com/mini), a more compact version of the original Hexcodle.

### **Relatle**

Our newest creation. If thesaurus.com is in your recents, consider playing our synonym-like game where you need to **find a daily mystery word based off related words given**. We are still workshopping this game to be more fun based on your feedback, but feel free to check it out if you'd like!

### **Unolingo**

MY FAVOURITE GAME EVER!!! Whoever created this I love you, I am obsessed, I sleep, eat, and dream Unolingo. Picture this, you're given a grid that looks like a crossword type of situation, but some letters are already filled in. You then have to **place each letter of the alphabet exactly ONCE in the grid to form proper words**. I think our best time playing this game was 1 minute and 5 seconds.

In conclusion, there are lots of super awesome Wordle-style games out there. If you have a favourite game that didn't make this list, we would love to hear your game suggestions! Shoot us an email at [hexcodle@gmail.com](mailto:hexcodle@gmail.com). See you next time!
