Hey Hexcodlers! _It's been a minute..._

First and foremost, Ekim and I want to thank you all for continuing to play Hexcodle every day. It's a privilege to have created something that so many people interact with each day 😊

### Life Update: We Moved!

Ekim got a job offer he couldn't refuse, so in April of this year, **we packed up our life in Toronto and moved over to the Pacific Northwest!** We're Seattleites now!

Moving was both fun-filled and stress-inducing. It's so bittersweet packing up all your belongings into boxes and saying goodbye to all your friends and family. Nevertheless, what an experience!

Ekim started work at the beginning of May and I started down a path (which felt like forever) trying to find a job & get my visa situated. As of last month, everything worked out _(yippee!!!!)_ and we finally have some time to put some much-needed maintenance into Hexcodle.

### Our Seattle Adventures So Far

I could ramble on and on about all the fun granola-girl activities we've been up to, but I'll keep it short(ish) & sum it up with a few images.

As always, **happy Hexcodle-ing!** 🌈
